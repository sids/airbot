# Claude PR Review Agent Rubric (Placeholder)

**Note**: This project uses [bd (beads)](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for issue tracking. Use `bd` commands instead of markdown TODOs. See AGENTS.md for workflow details.

This file will hold the detailed review rubric consumed by the Claude Agent SDK. Populate it with project-specific standards (style, security, testing expectations) once the implementation phase begins.
